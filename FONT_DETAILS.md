# sitelen pona font details

## both fonts

- *akesi*: uses two pairs of legs, which is more biologically accurate.
- *moli*: uses an alternative glyph that is already used in pixel fonts (cf. [*leko majuna*](https://kelseyhigham.github.io/leko-majuna/)/*sin*), which uses a closed mouth instead of a head (using a head would require more horizontal space).
- *olin*: the hearts are filled.
- *pu*: inverts the color, which is seen in *leko majuna*.

## wide font only

- *jaki*: reuses the style from *linja pona*.

## narrow font only

- *ante* and *kijetesantakalu*: both reuse the style from [*sitelen Sa*](https://jackhumbert.github.io/sitelen-sa/).
- *jaki*: uses a custom scribble.
- *pimeja*: reverses the colors.
