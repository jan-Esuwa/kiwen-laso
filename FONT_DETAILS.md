# sitelen pona font details

## both fonts

- *akesi*: uses two pairs of legs, which is more biologically accurate.
- *moli*: uses an alternative glyph that is already used in pixel fonts (cf. *leko majuna*/*sin*), which uses a closed mouth instead of a head (using a head would require more horizontal space).
- *olin*: the hearts are filled.
- *pu*: inverts the color, which is seen in *leko majuna*.

## wide font only

## narrow font only
