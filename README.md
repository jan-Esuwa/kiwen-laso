**musi Pokemon nanpa kiwen laso** is a translation of "Pokémon Emerald" into Toki Pona. It is based on [PRET's Pokémon Emerald decompilation](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/) to implement sitelen pona symbols into the font.

## Features

- Full compatibility with the vanilla Generation III games
- In-game text mostly in sitelen pona.
    - Characters for all *nimi pu* and *nimi ku suli* are included (with two variants of *sewi*), plus those for *apeja*, *majuna*, *pake*, and *powe*, since those are in the UCSUR encoding of sitelen pona.
    - Opening and closing cartouches are included, plus the dot and colon to use in [*nasin sitelen kalama*](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nasin_sitelen_kalama).
    - All text input is exclusively in Latin script, so this covers nicknames, your name, box names, and Walda (jan Sipi)'s password.
- Quality of life changes:
    - You can run everywhere from the start
    - Stats modified by the nature are indicated with arrows on the summary screen.
    - The Move Reminder in Fallarbor Town can teach moves from pre-evolutions.
    - Reusable repels
    - If you use an item on a Pokémon outside of battle, you must press B to go back to the Bag. This allows repeated usage
    - Kiri can give Wiki, Mago, and Aguav Berries
    - HMs can be removed at any time
    - Post-game only:
        - Move Tutors across Hoenn have no use limit.
        - Battle Frontier tutors have their prices cut, to a maximum of 16 BP
        - A TM shop in Lilycove City, where you can buy every TM.
        - Battles with several returning characters in newly added areas, plus jan Esuwa himself.
            - Once you defeat all of them, they can challenge the Elite Four to take away your title!
        - You can get all 386 Pokémon without trading.
        - Mirage Island appears permanently after you defeat Wallace
        - Kiri can give Liechi, Ganlon, Salac, Petaya, and Apicot Berries
